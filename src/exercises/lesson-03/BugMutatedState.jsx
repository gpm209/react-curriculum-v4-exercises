/*
  BUG #2 — State Issue

  This component displays a count and updates it when the button is clicked.
  However, the way the count is being changed causes the component to behave
  incorrectly.
*/

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function BugMutatedState() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAdd() {
    setCount((previous) => previous + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bug 2 Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
// In the initial setcount, the state variable is mutated direct by using the count++, which is not how React detect changes in the state.
//React relies on the setCount function to detect any changes in the state and re-render the component.
//The setCount function use the previous for the previous state and add 1 to it when it updates it.
